## About the Project:
  The main idea behind Alexandryte is to manage and list any media you are consuming or intend to consume. I often read some manga that have 
  several hiatuses, so i used to forget some manga that i was reading or wanted to read. This was also true for movies, series, books, etc.
  
  With that in mind, i started looking for sites and apps that could help me with that but none were fit for my tastes or needs. So, i decided to do what programmers do: **Build myself what i needed**.
